# l6-ifcs-sum2
This is a repo for the second summative assignment for the intensive foundations of computer science module in the L6 data science apprenticeship.

## Introduction

This project was developed within the context of the Department for Education (DfE), specifically reflecting the work of the Statistics Services Unit (SSU) operating alongside the Head of Profession for Statistics (HoP) office within the [Government Statistical Service (GSS)](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/government-statistical-service-and-statistician-group/). This environment involves the production, analysis, and dissemination of official education statistics, with close alignment to professional standards set by the GSS. Staff are expected to apply the UK Code of Practice for Statistics when producing and communicating data to ensure outputs are trustworthy, high quality, and serve the public good.

The quiz application is relevant to the DfE as understanding the Code of Practice is essential for analysts and statisticians working under the leadership of the HoP. Within the Statistics Services Unit, the Code underpins decisions about data quality, transparency, and communication. The quiz supports employer needs by providing an accessible learning resource that can be used for staff development, onboarding, and continuing professional development activities, helping reinforce professional standards in a practical way.

The project was delivered as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in order to focus on essential functionality while remaining achievable within time and resource constraints. The MVP includes core features such as multiple choice questions, user input, and feedback, ensuring the application delivers learning value without unnecessary complexity. This reflects common practice in public sector digital and analytical projects, where iterative development is encouraged.

The application has been developed using Streamlit in Python. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and instructions for running the application locally.
