st.markdown("# About the Code of Practice")

st.markdown("""The Code of Practice for Statistics is a set of standards and principles designed to ensure that official statistics published in the UK are trustworthy, high quality, and valuable to everyone who uses them — from decision-makers and analysts to members of the public.""")

st.markdown("## What is the Code of Practice?")

st.markdown("""The Code sets out how statistics should be produced and communicated so they serve the public good. 

It was created under UK law and maintained by the Office for Statistics Regulation, part of the UK Statistics Authority. 

When producers follow the Code, users can be confident that the statistics are reliable, transparent and free from inappropriate influence.

While the Code applies formally to official statistics produced by government bodies, its core ideas can be helpful for anyone working with data and statistics — whether you’re a student, journalist, researcher, policy maker, or data fan.""")

st.markdown("# Why the Code Matters")

st.markdown("""The Code exists to strengthen trust in statistics by promoting:

-   Trustworthiness – users can be confident in who produced the statistics and how decisions were made.

-   Quality – statistics are based on suitable data and sound methods.

-   Value – statistics meet user needs and are accessible and useful.

By following these principles, statistics help inform better decision-making, support public accountability, and reduce confusion or misuse of data.""")

st.markdown("## Who Uses It?")

st.markdown("""The Code is officially required for organisations producing National Statistics, but its principles can also be applied voluntarily by other groups who publish or analyse data. This includes public bodies, analysts, communicators and anyone who wants to demonstrate good data practice.""")
